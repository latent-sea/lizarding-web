// The builder: the vocabulary an application describes its screens in, and
// the turning of a description into elements. What it describes is data
// (desc.js); what it builds draws itself from what it read, again whenever
// any of it moves.
//
// gd-chime for the web. MIT licensed; see LICENCE beside this file.
//
// A PIECE THAT READS A BOUND VALUE FOLLOWS IT: its draw runs with what it
// reads noted (reads.js), and the chimes wire it to exactly those bells.
// When one rings, the piece is marked and drawn again on the next frame,
// once, never inside the ring. A piece taken away - a when turning, an each
// losing an item, the app unmounted - stops hearing everything.
//
// A PRESS GOES THROUGH THE DOOR: a pressable dispatches its action in the
// place it stands in (its region), and shows the refusal on its face, under
// its words, rather than in a tooltip a finger never sees. While the door
// would refuse it, it is inert and says why. A press that goes somewhere -
// goesTo, opens - is the place's move: the place declares where the action
// goes as the pressable is built, and the driver carries the reader there.
//
// A POP-UP IS DESCRIBED WHERE IT IS USED - beside the button opening it -
// and lifted beside the app by the builder, once, its name the builder's:
// its kind and how many of that kind were described before it. Its content
// is a function of the parameter it is entered with, handed in as a bound
// value. Every pop-up owns its way out: CLOSES, which goes back.
