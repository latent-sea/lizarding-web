// The application: what a site extends. It answers five questions, each with
// a default - look(), the look it wears; sources(), the words it reads;
// declare(register), its actions and their words, in one table; describe(),
// the app's description, its models made on the way; probe(), the walk that
// stands in for a reader - and is mounted into an element of the page.
//
// gd-chime for the web. MIT licensed; see LICENCE beside this file.
//
// THE BUILD ORDER, as it is mounted: the look dresses the element; the
// chimes, the driver and the door are made; the register is declared; the
// builder is made and the description built; at the frame's end the
// description's faults are checked and the reader brought to the app. A
// description with a fault in it is reported in the console and the app
// stands empty (broken(faults)). Opened with ?probe, the page walks itself.
//
// A KEY THE APP TAKES IS THE APP'S: a key pressed is put, innermost place
// first, to every place on top that declares an action on that key, and
// dispatched there; a key typed into a field is the field's, except Escape.
