// THE INDEX, by family:
// - The application: ChimeApp, which a site extends, answering look(),
//   sources(), declare(), describe() and probe().
// - The vocabulary: the builder (app.ui) - text, image, embed, surface, paragraph,
//   bars, link, hyperlink, divider, pressable, pressLocal, reason, button, field, file, area, row,
//   column, grid, stack, scroll, each, eachAcross, when, local, bound,
//   parameter, and the places: app, screen, tabs, popUp; Desc, a
//   description; Bound, a value a description reads.
// - The look: Look and its PALETTE; Themes, Pressables, Fields, Navigation,
//   Overlays, the names of the styles.
// - The floor: Chimes, Commands, Controller, Driver, Actions, Phrase,
//   Language, Frames.
// - The walk: Walk, which a site's probe extends.
